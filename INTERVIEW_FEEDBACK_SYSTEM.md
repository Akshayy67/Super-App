# Interview Feedback System

## Overview

The Interview Feedback System is an AI-powered analysis tool that provides comprehensive feedback on mock interview performances. It uses Google Gemini AI to analyze different aspects of interview conversations and provides structured feedback across multiple dimensions.

## Features

### üîç **Multi-Dimensional Analysis**
The system analyzes interviews across 5 key areas:

1. **Communication Skills** - Clarity, articulation, professional language usage
2. **Technical Knowledge** - Depth of technical understanding and problem-solving
3. **Behavioral Responses** - STAR method usage and soft skills demonstration
4. **Areas for Improvement** - Specific weaknesses and actionable suggestions
5. **Key Strengths** - Positive aspects and strong points

### üìä **Scoring System**
- Each section receives a score out of 10
- Overall performance score calculated from all sections
- Color-coded scoring (Green: 8-10, Yellow: 6-7, Red: 0-5)

### üéØ **AI-Powered Insights**
- Uses Google Gemini AI for intelligent analysis
- Separate API calls for different analysis sections
- Context-aware feedback based on role and difficulty level

## How It Works

### 1. **Data Collection**
- Captures all interview conversation messages
- Filters out system messages
- Prepares conversation context for AI analysis

### 2. **Parallel Analysis**
The system makes 4 separate API calls to Gemini AI:

```typescript
// Communication Analysis
analyzeCommunication(conversation, role, difficulty)

// Technical Skills Analysis  
analyzeTechnicalSkills(conversation, role, difficulty)

// Behavioral Analysis
analyzeBehavioralAspects(conversation, role, difficulty)

// Overall Performance Analysis
analyzeOverallPerformance(conversation, role, difficulty, interviewType)
```

### 3. **Structured Feedback Generation**
Each analysis returns:
- **Score**: Numerical rating (1-10)
- **Content**: Detailed analysis text
- **Suggestions**: Actionable improvement tips

### 4. **Feedback Presentation**
- Modal interface with organized sections
- Visual score indicators
- Downloadable feedback report
