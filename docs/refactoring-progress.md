# Interview Prep App Refactoring Progress

## Overview
This document tracks the progress of refactoring the Interview Prep application from state-based navigation to a proper route-based structure with comprehensive question banks and code solutions.

## Completed Tasks ✅

### 1. React Router Infrastructure
- ✅ Installed react-router-dom and @types/react-router-dom
- ✅ Created AppRouter.tsx with centralized routing configuration
- ✅ Implemented useCurrentRoute.ts hook for route state management
- ✅ Updated App.tsx to use React Router instead of state-based navigation
- ✅ Modified Sidebar.tsx to use React Router navigation
- ✅ Updated Dashboard.tsx to replace onViewChange with navigate()

### 2. Module Route Structure
- ✅ Created InterviewPrepRouter.tsx for nested routing
- ✅ Implemented InterviewPrepLayout.tsx with tab navigation
- ✅ Created route components:
  - ✅ InterviewOverview.tsx - Welcome page with feature cards and statistics
  - ✅ InterviewPractice.tsx - Practice sessions with filtering and progress tracking
  - ✅ InterviewQuestionBank.tsx - Wrapper for existing QuestionBank component
  - ✅ InterviewViewCode.tsx - Code solutions browser with search and filtering
  - ✅ InterviewReferences.tsx - Curated resources and documentation links
- ✅ Updated main InterviewPrep.tsx to use the new router

### 3. Expanded Question Banks
- ✅ **AlgorithmQuestions**: 30 questions (exceeds requirement)
- ✅ **ReactQuestions**: 25 questions (meets requirement)
- ✅ **JavaScriptQuestions**: 14 questions (expanded from 5, includes comprehensive examples)
- ✅ **BehavioralQuestions**: 15 questions (expanded from 5, covers various scenarios)
- ✅ **SystemDesignQuestions**: 5 questions (baseline, needs expansion)

#### Question Types Implemented:
- ✅ Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ)
- ✅ Coding Problems with implementations
- ✅ Debugging Scenarios
- ✅ Theory Questions
- ✅ Behavioral Situations using STAR method
- ✅ Case Studies and Problem-solving

#### Difficulty Levels:
- ✅ Easy (beginner-friendly questions)
- ✅ Medium (intermediate complexity)
- ✅ Hard (advanced concepts and scenarios)

### 4. Code Solutions Implementation
- ✅ **Multi-language Support**: Python, TypeScript, and Java implementations
- ✅ **Comprehensive Examples**:
  - Two Sum problem with hash map and brute force approaches
  - Stock trading problem with single pass and DP approaches
  - String reversal with 5+ different approaches per language
- ✅ **Code Quality Features**:
  - Time and space complexity analysis
  - Multiple solution approaches (brute-force, optimal, moderate)
  - Test cases and performance comparisons
  - Detailed explanations for each approach
  - Language-specific best practices

#### Example Implementation Coverage:
- ✅ Array manipulation algorithms
- ✅ String processing techniques
- ✅ Hash table/map usage patterns
- ✅ Two-pointer techniques
- ✅ Dynamic programming approaches
- ✅ Recursion vs iteration trade-offs
- ✅ Performance optimization strategies

## Current Application Features

```

### Question Bank Statistics
- **Total Questions**: 89+ across all categories
- **Code Implementations**: 15+ complete solutions in 3 languages
- **Categories**: Algorithms, React, JavaScript, Behavioral, System Design, Frontend, Database, etc.
- **Difficulty Distribution**: Balanced across easy, medium, and hard levels

### Code Solution Features
- **Languages**: Python, TypeScript, Java
- **Approaches**: Multiple solutions per problem (brute-force to optimal)
- **Analysis**: Time/space complexity for each solution
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test cases and performance comparisons
- **Documentation**: Detailed explanations and best practices

## Next Steps (Remaining Tasks)

### 5. UI Component Cleanup
- Remove redundancies and consolidate View Code sections
- Improve accessibility and keyboard support
- Enhance mobile responsiveness

### 6. Global Question Management System
- Implement manifest.json for question metadata
- Create per-module questions.json files
- Establish question versioning and updates

### 7. Code Solutions Storage Organization
- Create /solutions/<module>/<question-id>/{python,typescript,java}/ structure
- Implement solution file management
- Add solution validation and testing framework

### 8. Duplicate Removal and Normalization
- Identify and remove duplicate questions/components
- Normalize naming conventions and folder structure
- Consolidate imports and dependencies

### 9. Documentation and Testing
- Generate complete routing map
- Create comprehensive how-to-run documentation
- Implement testing for routes and coding questions
- Add refactoring notes and deduplication report

### 10. Final Integration and Validation
- Ensure all code compiles and passes linting
- Validate API stability and backward compatibility
- Performance testing and optimization
- Final quality assurance

## Technical Achievements
