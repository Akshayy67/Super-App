## 🎯 STUDENT ACQUISITION STRATEGY

### Viral Loops:

**Loop 1: Referral Program**
```
Student A signs up
→ Invites 3 friends (gets 3 months free)
→ Friends sign up (network effect)
→ Each friend invites 3 more
→ Exponential growth
```

**Loop 2: Social Proof**
```
Student gets job at Google
→ Posts on LinkedIn with certificate
→ Friends see post (FOMO)
→ Friends sign up
→ More placements → More posts
```

**Loop 3: College Ambassadors**
```
Ambassador promotes in college
→ 50-100 sign-ups
→ Forms study groups
→ Peer pressure to join
→ Entire batch onboards
```

**Loop 4: Content Marketing**
```
SEO blog post ranks #1
→ 10,000 visitors/month
→ 10% sign up (1000 users)
→ More content → More traffic
```

### Growth Channels (Priority Order):

1. **College Ambassadors** (Lowest CAC: ₹20-50/user)
2. **Referral Program** (CAC: ₹50-100/user)
3. **Content Marketing** (CAC: ₹100-200/user)
