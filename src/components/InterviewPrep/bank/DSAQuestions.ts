    question: "Find two numbers in an array that add up to a target sum (Two Sum)",
    category: "arrays",
    difficulty: "easy",
    type: "technical",
    sampleAnswer: "Use a hash map to store numbers and their indices. For each element, check if (target - current element) exists in the hash map. If yes, return the indices. If no, add current element to hash map. Time complexity: O(n), Space complexity: O(n).",
    tips: [
      "Consider using a hash map for O(1) lookup",
      "Handle edge cases like duplicate numbers",
      "Discuss brute force vs optimized approach"
    ],

    id: "dsa-2",
    question: "Find the maximum subarray sum (Kadane's Algorithm)",
    category: "arrays",
    difficulty: "medium",
    type: "technical",
    sampleAnswer: "Use Kadane's algorithm: maintain a running sum, reset to 0 when it becomes negative, and track the maximum sum seen so far. The key insight is that a negative prefix doesn't help maximize the sum. Time complexity: O(n), Space complexity: O(1).",
    tips: [
      "Explain the intuition behind Kadane's algorithm",
      "Handle all negative numbers case",
      "Discuss dynamic programming approach"
    ],

    question: "Rotate an array to the right by k steps",
    category: "arrays",
    difficulty: "medium",
    type: "technical",
    sampleAnswer: "Three approaches: 1) Extra space: create new array with elements at correct positions. 2) Reverse approach: reverse entire array, then reverse first k elements, then reverse remaining elements. 3) Cyclic replacements: move elements to their final positions in cycles. Reverse approach is most elegant with O(1) space.",
    tips: [
      "Consider k > array length case",
      "Discuss in-place vs extra space solutions",
      "Explain the reverse method step by step"

    id: "dsa-4",
    question: "Remove duplicates from sorted array in-place",
    category: "arrays",
    difficulty: "easy",
    type: "technical",
    sampleAnswer: "Use two pointers: one for reading (fast) and one for writing (slow). When fast pointer finds a new unique element, copy it to slow pointer position and increment slow. Return slow + 1 as the new length. Time complexity: O(n), Space complexity: O(1).",
    tips: [
      "Emphasize in-place modification",
      "Handle empty array edge case",
      "Explain why two pointers work here"

    id: "dsa-5",
    question: "Find the intersection of two arrays",
    category: "arrays",
    difficulty: "easy",
    type: "technical",
    sampleAnswer: "Two approaches: 1) Hash set: put one array in a set, iterate through second array and check membership. 2) Sort both arrays and use two pointers. Hash set approach is generally better with O(n+m) time complexity. Handle duplicates by using a frequency map if needed.",
    tips: [
      "Consider if arrays are sorted",
      "Handle duplicate elements properly",
      "Discuss space-time tradeoffs"

  // String Questions
  {
    id: "dsa-6",
    question: "Check if a string is a valid palindrome",
    category: "strings",
    difficulty: "easy",
    type: "technical",
    sampleAnswer: "Use two pointers from start and end, moving towards center. Compare characters after converting to lowercase and skipping non-alphanumeric characters. Return false if any mismatch found. Time complexity: O(n), Space complexity: O(1).",
    tips: [
      "Handle case sensitivity and special characters",
      "Consider recursive vs iterative approach",

    question: "Find the longest substring without repeating characters",
    category: "strings",
    difficulty: "medium",
    type: "technical",
    sampleAnswer: "Use sliding window technique with a hash set. Expand window by moving right pointer and adding characters to set. When duplicate found, shrink window from left until duplicate is removed. Track maximum window size. Time complexity: O(n), Space complexity: O(min(m,n)) where m is charset size.",

      "Explain sliding window concept clearly",
      "Handle empty string edge case",
      "Discuss optimization using character indices"
