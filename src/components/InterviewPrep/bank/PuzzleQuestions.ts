If the first group originally had h heads, after flipping it will have (X-h) heads. For equal heads in both groups: (X-h) = (H-h), which gives us X = H.

    category: "logical",
    difficulty: "medium",
    type: "technical",
    sampleAnswer: "The winning strategy is to always leave your opponent with a multiple of 4 coins. Since players can take 1, 2, or 3 coins, whatever they take, you can take enough to make the total taken in that round equal to 4. Starting with 20 coins (multiple of 4), the second player has the winning strategy.

If only pirates 4 and 5 remain, pirate 4 takes all 100 coins. If pirates 3, 4, 5 remain, pirate 3 needs pirate 5's vote, so offers 1 to pirate 5 (pirate 5 prefers 1 over 0). With pirates 2, 3, 4, 5, pirate 2 needs 2 votes; offers 1 to pirate 4 and 1 to pirate 3. With all 5 pirates, senior needs 3 votes total (including his own), so he needs 2 more votes.

This is true regardless of how you make the cuts - whether you stack pieces or cut them individually. The key insight is that each cut operation can only increase the piece count by 1, so to go from 1 piece to 9 pieces requires exactly 8 cuts.",

If the barber shaves himself, then he belongs to the group of men who shave themselves, but he's supposed to only shave men who don't shave themselves. If he doesn't shave himself, then he belongs to the group of men who don't shave themselves, which means he should shave himself.
