    question: "Explain the OSI model and its seven layers",
    category: "networking-fundamentals",
    difficulty: "medium",
    type: "technical",
    sampleAnswer: "The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework with 7 layers: 1) Physical Layer: transmission of raw bits over physical medium (cables, wireless). 2) Data Link Layer: node-to-node delivery, error detection/correction, MAC addresses, Ethernet. 3) Network Layer: routing between networks, IP addresses, routers. 4) Transport Layer: end-to-end delivery, TCP/UDP, flow control, error recovery. 5) Session Layer: session management, authentication, checkpointing. 6) Presentation Layer: data formatting, encryption, compression. 7) Application Layer: network services to applications, HTTP, FTP, SMTP. Each layer provides services to the layer above and uses services from the layer below, enabling modular network design.",

    question: "Difference between TCP and UDP protocols",
    category: "transport-protocols",
    difficulty: "easy",
    type: "technical",
    sampleAnswer: "TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is connection-oriented, reliable, and provides ordered delivery with error checking, flow control, and congestion control. It uses 3-way handshake for connection establishment and guarantees data delivery. UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is connectionless, unreliable, and provides fast, low-overhead communication without guarantees. TCP is used for applications requiring reliability (HTTP, FTP, email), while UDP is used for real-time applications where speed matters more than reliability (video streaming, online gaming, DNS).",

    type: "technical",
    sampleAnswer: "Subnetting divides a large network into smaller subnetworks using subnet masks. It provides: 1) Better organization and management of large networks. 2) Improved security through network segmentation. 3) Reduced broadcast traffic by limiting broadcast domains. 4) More efficient use of IP address space. Subnet mask determines network vs host portions of IP address. For example, 192.168.1.0/24 means first 24 bits are network, last 8 bits are host, allowing 254 host addresses. VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Masking) allows different subnet sizes for efficient address utilization.",

    type: "technical",
    sampleAnswer: "NAT (Network Address Translation) allows multiple devices on a private network to share a single public IP address. When a device sends a packet out, NAT replaces the private source IP with the public IP and stores the mapping in a translation table. For incoming responses, NAT uses the table to forward packets to the correct internal device. Types include: Static NAT (one-to-one mapping), Dynamic NAT (pool of public IPs), and PAT/NAPT (Port Address Translation using different ports). NAT enables IPv4 address conservation and provides basic security by hiding internal network structure.",

    difficulty: "hard",
    type: "technical",
    sampleAnswer: "Distance Vector (like RIP): each router maintains distance table to all destinations, periodically shares entire table with neighbors, uses Bellman-Ford algorithm. Pros: simple implementation. Cons: slow convergence, count-to-infinity problem. Link State (like OSPF): each router maintains complete network topology, floods link state information, uses Dijkstra's algorithm locally. Pros: fast convergence, no loops.

    sampleAnswer: "ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) maps IP addresses to MAC addresses on local networks. When a device needs to send data to an IP address on the same subnet: 1) Check ARP cache for existing mapping. 2) If not found, broadcast ARP request asking 'Who has this IP?'. 3) Device with that IP responds with ARP reply containing its MAC address. 4) Sender caches the mapping and uses MAC address for frame delivery. ARP is necessary because Ethernet uses MAC addresses for local delivery while applications use IP addresses.",

Process: 1) Client connects to SMTP server on port 25. 2) HELO/EHLO: client identifies itself. 3) MAIL FROM: specify sender address. 4) RCPT TO: specify recipient address(es). 5) DATA: transmit email content. 6) QUIT: close connection. For email retrieval, clients use POP3 (download and delete) or IMAP (server-based storage). Modern email uses SMTP for sending, IMAP for accessing, with TLS encryption for security.",

    question: "What is network latency and how to minimize it?",
    category: "performance",
    difficulty: "medium",
    type: "technical",
    sampleAnswer: "Network latency is the time delay for data to travel from source to destination. Components: 1) Propagation delay: physical distance and medium speed. 2) Transmission delay: time to put data on wire. 3) Processing delay: router/switch processing time. 4) Queuing delay: waiting in buffers. Minimization strategies: 1) Reduce physical distance (CDNs, edge computing). 2) Use faster links and protocols. 3) Optimize routing paths. 4) Implement QoS for priority traffic. 5) Reduce packet size. 6) Use connection pooling and keep-alive. 7) Implement caching at multiple levels.",

    category: "performance",
    difficulty: "easy",
    type: "technical",
    sampleAnswer: "Bandwidth is the maximum data transmission capacity of a network link (theoretical limit), measured in bits per second. Throughput is the actual data transfer rate achieved in practice, always ≤ bandwidth due to protocol overhead, network congestion, and other factors. Factors affecting throughput: 1) Protocol overhead (headers, acknowledgments). 2) Network congestion and packet loss. 3) Latency and round-trip time. 4) Window size limitations in TCP. 5) Application efficiency. Bandwidth-delay product determines optimal window size for maximum throughput.",

    category: "switching",
    difficulty: "medium",
    type: "technical",
    sampleAnswer: "STP prevents loops in switched networks by creating a loop-free logical topology. Process: 1) Elect root bridge (lowest bridge ID). 2) Each non-root bridge finds shortest path to root. 3) Select root ports (best path to root) and designated ports (best path to each segment). 4) Block redundant ports to eliminate loops. When topology changes, STP reconverges. Variants include RSTP (Rapid STP) for faster convergence and MSTP (Multiple STP) for VLAN-aware operation. STP ensures broadcast storms don't occur while maintaining redundancy.",
