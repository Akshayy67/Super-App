# Meeting Join Fix - Test Guide

## Problem Fixed
Previously, when someone tried to join a meeting using a meeting ID, they would automatically become the host instead of joining as a participant. This happened because the code was checking if the meeting existed locally and creating a new meeting if it didn't find one.

## Solution Implemented
1. **Updated `joinMeeting` method**: Now never assumes host status when joining
2. **Enhanced signaling service**: Added proper meeting state management and participant tracking
3. **Improved participant handling**: Server response determines host status based on existing participants

## Key Changes Made

### 1. WebRTC Service (`src/utils/webrtcService.ts`)
- **`joinMeeting` method**: Always sets `isHost: false` initially
- **`handleMeetingParticipants` method**: Properly determines host status based on server response
  - If existing participants found → current user is NOT host
  - If no existing participants → current user becomes host

### 2. Signaling Service (`src/utils/signalingService.ts`)
- Added `join-meeting` and `meeting-participants` message types
- Added meeting state tracking with `meetingParticipants` Map
- Added `handleJoinMeetingRequest` method to respond with existing participants
- Enhanced message handling to process join requests

## How to Test the Fix

### Test 1: First User (Should Become Host)
1. Open the application in browser tab 1
2. Navigate to Team Space → Live Meeting
3. Create a new meeting or note the meeting ID
4. **Expected Result**: User becomes host (should see host controls)

### Test 2: Second User (Should Join as Participant)
1. Open the application in browser tab 2 (or incognito window)
2. Navigate to Team Space → Live Meeting
3. Enter the SAME meeting ID from Test 1
4. Click "Join Meeting"
5. **Expected Result**: User joins as participant (NOT host)

### Test 3: Multiple Participants
1. Repeat Test 2 with additional browser tabs/windows
2. **Expected Result**: All subsequent users join as participants

## Console Logs to Watch For

When joining a meeting, you should see these logs in the browser console:

```
🔄 Attempting to join meeting: [meeting-id]
📤 Sending join-meeting request for: [user-name]
🔄 Processing join-meeting request from [user-name]
📋 Sending existing participants (X) to [user-name]
📋 Received existing participants: X
👤 Current user is joining existing meeting (not host)  // For non-first users
👑 Current user is the first participant (becomes host)  // For first user only
```

## Verification Points

### ✅ Correct Behavior
- First user to join becomes host
- Subsequent users join as participants
- Meeting ID works consistently across browser tabs
- No duplicate meetings created

### ❌ Previous Incorrect Behavior (Now Fixed)
- ~~Every user becomes host~~
- ~~New meeting created for each join attempt~~
- ~~Meeting ID doesn't work for joining existing meetings~~

## Technical Details

### Message Flow
1. User calls `joinMeeting(meetingId)`
2. WebRTC service sends `join-meeting` message to signaling service
3. Signaling service responds with `meeting-participants` message
4. WebRTC service processes response and sets host status accordingly

### Host Determination Logic
```typescript
if (existingParticipants.length > 0) {
  // User is joining existing meeting → NOT host
  currentParticipant.isHost = false;
} else {
  // User is first participant → becomes host
  currentParticipant.isHost = true;
}
```

## Additional Notes
- The fix works with both WebSocket and BroadcastChannel signaling
- Meeting state is properly cleaned up when participants leave
- The solution is backward compatible with existing meeting creation flow
