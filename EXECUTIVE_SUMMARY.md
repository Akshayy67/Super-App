## 📊 Current State vs. Competitors

### vs. Edwisely (Main Institutional Competitor)

| Dimension | Edwisely | SuperApp | Winner |
|-----------|----------|----------|--------|
| **Target Market** | Large universities ($50K-500K/year) | Students + Institutions ($0-50K/year) | SuperApp (larger TAM) |
| **Student Engagement** | ⭐⭐ Low (admin-focused) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ High (student-loved) | **SuperApp** |
| **Institutional Analytics** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Best-in-class | ⭐⭐⭐ Basic | Edwisely |
| **Job Placement** | ❌ None | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Automated from 10+ sources | **SuperApp** |
| **Peer Collaboration** | ❌ Limited | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Real-time study rooms | **SuperApp** |
| **Time to Value** | 3-6 months | Immediate | **SuperApp** |
| **Pricing** | $50K-500K/year | $0-50K/year | **SuperApp** |
| **Valuation** | ~$50M (est.) | TBD | - |

### Key Insight:
> SuperApp and Edwisely solve different problems. **Edwisely's weakness is SuperApp's strength** (student engagement), and **SuperApp's weakness is Edwisely's strength** (institutional analytics).
