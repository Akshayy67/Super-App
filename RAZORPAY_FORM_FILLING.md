Super Study App is a unified academic ecosystem platform that consolidates 15+ fragmented student productivity tools into a single, integrated SaaS application. We provide subscription-based access to AI-powered learning assistance, HD video collaboration, interview preparation analytics, task management, team collaboration tools, and comprehensive study resources.

Our platform serves university and college students across India who need an all-in-one solution for their academic and career preparation needs. Instead of using 15+ separate apps (Zoom, Notion, ChatGPT, etc.), students can access everything through one subscription.

Revenue is generated through monthly and yearly premium subscriptions priced at ₹249/month and ₹2,399/year respectively, with special student discounts at ₹50/month. We expect 500-10,000 transactions monthly depending on growth phase.

The business model is freemium SaaS where users can sign up for free and upgrade to premium for full feature access. Payment processing is required for recurring subscription billing and student-friendly payment options like UPI.
