## üöÄ How to Start the WebSocket Server (Optional)

The WebSocket signaling server is **optional** - your app works fully without it using BroadcastChannel for local meetings.

### Option 1: Using the Node.js script
```bash
node start-signaling.js
```

### Option 2: Manual start
```bash
cd signaling-server
npm install
npm start
```

### Option 3: Using the batch file (Windows)
```bash
start-signaling-server.bat
```

## üìä File Size Handling

| File Size | Storage Method | Notes |
